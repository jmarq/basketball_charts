So what's going on here?

BASKETBALL CHARTS
*************************

chart idea #1:
    create 82(66?) game array for each team, representing a season
	in each array slot there will be an integer representing the teams level above .500
	    after that game. [0] will be -1 if the team loses 1st game, 1 if win. [1] will be 0 if team splits...
	
	group teams by division.
	plot teams level as line chart, plot common division members on same chart.
	
	how to get array for each team?
	    go to each teams schedule/result webpage
		or, go to list of all games from that season.
	
	what about....
	    python script that loads html for entire schedule/results page
		   goes game by game through the table
		   determines winning team and losing team's name
		   pushes a W or L (or pushes the new level above .500, by looking at previous and adding 1 or -1)
		   saves entire set as json file
		   html/javascript/highcharts frontend displays graphs.
